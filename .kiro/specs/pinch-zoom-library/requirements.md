# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A vanilla JavaScript library that provides Instagram-like pinch zoom functionality for images with cross-browser compatibility. The library should be easy to use, configurable, and suitable for npm distribution.

## Glossary

- **PinchZoom_Library**: The main vanilla JavaScript library that provides pinch zoom functionality
- **Target_Image**: Any HTML image element that will have pinch zoom functionality applied
- **Overlay_Element**: A background overlay element that appears during zoom interactions
- **Zoom_Session**: The period from when a user starts pinching until they release their fingers
- **Scale_Factor**: The multiplication factor applied to the image size during zoom
- **Background_Color**: The configurable color of the overlay that appears during zoom
- **API_Method**: The public interface methods exposed by the library
- **Touch_Event**: Browser touch events (touchstart, touchmove, touchend) used for pinch detection

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to easily add pinch zoom functionality to images on my website, so that users can zoom in on images like they do on Instagram.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports the PinchZoom_Library, THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL provide a simple API to enable pinch zoom on Target_Images
2. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL support both querySelector string and direct DOM element as input parameters
3. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL work across different browsers and devices without compatibility issues
4. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL be distributable via npm package manager
5. WHERE a developer provides a querySelector string, THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL automatically apply pinch zoom to all matching Target_Images

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to customize the appearance of the zoom overlay, so that it matches my website's design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL accept a background_color configuration option
2. WHEN background_color is provided, THE Overlay_Element SHALL use the specified color during Zoom_Sessions
3. WHEN background_color is not provided, THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL use a default white overlay color
4. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL support standard CSS color formats (hex, rgb, rgba, named colors)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to pinch zoom images smoothly and intuitively, so that I can examine image details easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a pinch gesture on a Target_Image, THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL detect the Touch_Events and calculate the Scale_Factor
2. WHILE a user is pinching, THE Target_Image SHALL scale smoothly between 1x and 5x magnification
3. WHEN a user releases their fingers, THE Target_Image SHALL return to its original size with smooth animation
4. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL maintain the zoom center point at the midpoint between the user's fingers
5. WHILE zooming is active, THE Overlay_Element SHALL display with opacity proportional to the Scale_Factor

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly integrate the library into my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL include a README file with installation and usage instructions
2. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL provide a working example HTML page demonstrating the functionality
3. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL document all available configuration options
4. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL include code examples for common use cases

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the library to have a clean and intuitive API, so that I can implement it quickly without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL expose a simple constructor or factory function as the main API_Method
2. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL accept configuration options as a single object parameter
3. WHEN invalid parameters are provided, THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the page
4. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL not require any external dependencies
5. THE PinchZoom_Library SHALL not interfere with existing page styles or functionality
